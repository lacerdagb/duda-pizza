== Description ==

Responsive Lightbox designed for photography which can also displays EXIF data. This lightbox is highly optimized and designed to be very fast and elegant. You will love it! Learn more about it here: [Meow Lightbox](https://meowapps.com/meow-lightbox/).

=== KEY FEATURES ===

- Responsive Images. Image resolution itself will adapt to the screen and device.
- Display Image / EXIF information. Shutter speed, aperture, camera, lens.

== DEMOS ==
If you want to see how it performs, have a look at those examples.

- With a gallery: [Nara Dreamland](https://haikyo.org/nara-dreamland/)
- With single photos: [Best Abandoned Places in Japan](https://offbeatjapan.org/best-abandoned-places-2014/)

=== GALLERY ===
We believe that choice of the gallery system depends on you. We however recommend you to use the [Meow Gallery](https://wordpress.org/plugins/meow-gallery/).

=== PRO ===
Getting the Pro version will support us and the development of the plugin, and also add those features:

- Preloading: the images will load faster (or even instantly) in the Lightbox.
- Google Maps: if GPS is available in your image, a map will be available.
- Deep-Linking: allow sharing an URL that will open the Lightbox directly on a specific image.
- Slideshow: you can start a slideshow from the Lightbox.

=== IMPORTANT ===
By default, the selector is set for the classes '.entry-content, .gallery, .mgl-gallery'. If you need the Lightbox to be active for more selectors, you will need to update the settings. The plugin will apply the lightbox for images contained by the selector. For more information, please check the [official page](https://meowapps.com/meow-lightbox/).

Languages: English.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `meow-lightbox` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
